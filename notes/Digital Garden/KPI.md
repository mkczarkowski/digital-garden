# KPIs

### Problem statement

**stakeholder** 
(describe person using empathetic language)
**NEEDS A WAY TO**
(needs are verbs)
**BECAUSE**
(describe what you’ve learned about the stakeholder’s needs in terms of business impact and urgency)

After having problem statement, turn it into KPI. Focus on user input over solution output.
